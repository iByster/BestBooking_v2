### Description
My bachelor's thesis project delved into cutting-edge web scraping and web crawling techniques, applying best practices to create a dynamic hotel booking website. This platform empowers users to effortlessly search for the best hotel prices across multiple websites and track historical price data. I successfully managed an extensive database comprising 160,000 hotels from around the world and 2,500,000 price records, honing my skills in handling vast datasets and implementing streaming approaches.

Furthermore, I gained expertise in web2 security measures such as authentication, cookies, CAPTCHA, and more, as these were vital components of the reverse engineering process. My project experience also sharpened my project management and architectural skills.

To bring this vision to life, I employed a robust technology stack, which included TypeScript, React, Node.js, Apollo (GraphQL), PostgreSQL, Puppeteer, Axios, JSDOM, Mocha, and Tailwind.
